# Current plan \(abridged\)
Right now focused on the core specification [WebAssembly Specification](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/)
* <del>Initial Control Opcodes such as 0x01 NOP and 0x0B END</del>
* Numeric Instructions by type i32, i64, f32, f64
    - const
    - math (i32 and i64)
        + <del>add</del>
        + <del>sub</del>
        + <del>mul</del>
        + div

JavaScript, Web, and WASI APIs will be added later once core operations are at a better point.
